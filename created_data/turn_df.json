being shipped to us from our manufacturer overseas and due to be dispatched from us 12.01.21.\nI have looked into this for you and can see there has been a slight shipping delay with the item causing the dispatch date to be pushed back.\nThis is currently delayed 29 days.\nWe get shipping updates every day and it is possible that this date will change and hopefully for the better.\nWe have had a few deliveries that have arrived quicker than expected but we are unable to say for sure.\nThere\u2019s currently a lot of pressure on global shipping around the world.\nAs a result, our products are taking longer to arrive into ports.\nThis does unfortunately mean that your dispatch date may change, or your order could be delayed.\nAs soon as it reaches our distribution centre we'll send it right over to our delivery partners.\nYou'll get another email to let you know it's been sent and give you a tracking number.\nOur delivery partners will then be in touch to arrange an exact delivery date.\nDelivery usually takes place within 1-7 working days after dispatch but this can vary depending on the couriers availability in your area.\n","42":"Sorry, that doesn't satisfy me.\nI'm already

item so we can take into account the length of the delay and your full customer journey.\nPlease advise if the item does arrive sooner than currently stated we may not be able to offer compensation.\nHowever we do completely understand if you do not want to wait anymore and the option to cancel the item is there if needed.\n","46":"No I want the article, I have already paid it!\nI

raise this with the team today and email you once I have an response.\n","1414":"That would be great.\nAccording to #PRS_ORG#, it is probably not broken but does not correspond to their terms and conditions - as bsw sent too low franked or similar.\nYou couldn't tell me\nSince the #PRS_ORG# has a special dimension you get \"not even\" another.\nThat's why it would be great if you found a solution\n","1415":"Of course, I understand #NAME#.\nI will send an email to our warehouse team this morning and as soon as I receive an update I will contact you.\n","1416":"Hello, I ordered two

doesn't help us either.\nThese are legal warranty claims.\nThe absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.\nThis is not only the legal obligation but also the standard in the

warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.\nThis is really very bad service.\n","1441":"Yes, I fully understand this - but this is torn\/worn, this is not to do with the quality of the item.\nwas this here when you first received the chair?\n","1442":"You can align your manager with the fact that they have lost two regular customers.\nMy friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.\nWe will no longer do that.\nNo, the defect occurred only after a few months.\nAn office chair must withstand normal use.\nOtherwise they may not sell him as an office chair.\nRegardless of this, the warranty is valid for Von 24 months.\n","1443":"Okay, did you let us know about this after the few months that this happened?\n","1444":"Obviously, the chair had an invisible lack of sale.\nHow else can such a padding damage occur after 9 months?\n","1445":"Okay, did you let us know about this after the few months that this happened?\n","1446":"Yes, I already reported a few months ago.\nUnfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.\nWe informed ourselves legally again and therefore wrote them again.\nWe originally reported half a year ago.\n","1447":"Okay, bear with me whilst I look at this information\n","1448":"Ok, thank you\n","1449":"Okay, I can see the previous correspondence - regrettably, we are unable to move forward with this - I am very sorry for the disappointment\n","1450":"All right.\nWe will no longer order anything from them.\nIf they add the revenue of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.\nThey are happy to forward this to their manager.\nThis is not competitive.\nGoodbye\n","1451":"Hello, is it possible to postpone a delivery date?\n","1452":"Good Morning\nThanks for

honestly admit that I am very disappointed about the #PRS_ORG# behavior and cannot understand the decision of your manager\nFrom 11 December to 8 January are again 1 month\nI don't know who is to blame\nAt the end of the day, you are responsible for your logistics partners and require impudent sums for a delivery that obviously didn't run smoothly\n","2041":"I understand your points but I am unable to move on this, I will arrange the voucher for you and have this emailed to you\n","2042":"I believe you have done everything in your power but I would like to redeem instead of a credit\nI

this is the information which shows on your order confirmation, then this will be the most accurate information we can provide\nThe dispatch times provided for each item on the website indicate how far through the manufacturing and shipping process the item is.\nThe longer dispatch times mean the item is likely still in the manufacturing phase, whereas shorter dispatch times mean the item is almost with us; this is why they will be ready to dispatch sooner.\nI regret this means we are not able to expedite orders.\n","3605":"This is no problem for me as long as the shipping times are adhered to.\nCan one assume that these 3-4 months are realistic, or is there a great probability that it will be later?\n","3606":"It can fluctuate either way.\nAny updates we receive which apply to the supply chain of your item, will show in an updated dispatch estimate.\nIt is not unusual for these to fluctuate throughout the process.\nDue to the unpredictability of the port congestion globally, some items have been delayed, but some are also being dispatched to customers sooner\nIf we can get your order into our warehouse sooner, it will begin preparing for dispatch immediately and you will be notified by email\nYou can check the progress of your order (the date of dispatch from our warehouse to the courier) through your 'my account' and 'my orders'.\nIf you have not set up an account and a pass word then please enter the email address used to place the order and use the 'forgotten password?'\noption to gain access to this information.\n","3607":"Perfect\n","3608":"Is there

compensation for the delay once everything is resolved.\n","3804":"Alright.\nYes I ask for compensation!\nHave they already shipped the goods?\n","3805":"The wardrobes are different to some of our

empathise with you, as you\u2019ve had to wait for this to be delivered, and we can assure you that we are as disappointed as you are as we do try and control 100% of the products when they leave the manufacturer.\nUnfortunately, things do slip through, despite our best efforts.\nOkay, so we have a couple of choices, I can reorder another for you on an 8-10 week lead time, you are of course welcome to hold onto the faulty until the new item arrives.\nAlternatively, I can arrange a partial refund of 60\u20ac or 100\u20ac #URL# voucher to keep the item as is\nLet me know what is best for you\n","3821":"Thanks for the offer.\nI find it very pity and exaggerated to get a new couch especially with regard to the associated environmental impact.\nTherefore, a re-shipment is only very reluctant to come into question.\nIn the case of an article about #NUMBER#\u20ac Von and shipping costs of 60\u20ac Von, however, I do not find the indemnification of 100\u20ac Von as a voucher sufficient.\n","3822":"Okay, I understand - what would you like to keep the item as is?\n","3823":"I want to know\nBut #NUMBER# 100\u20ac coupon is not enough as compensation\n","3824":"Okay, I can offer 100\u20ac partial refund\nor 150\u20ac #URL# voucher\n","3825":"100\u20ac is unfortunately not even 10% of the value we spent.\nThe usual discount for faulty items is 20%.\nThat would be 220\u20ac refund\n","3826":"There is no usual discount - It is taken on how much damage and what other options that we have - it varies from 10% as a minimum\nI can reorder the item for you if you would prefer\n","3827":"No thanks.\nThen I accept the 100\u20ac refund\nDo they have my bank details?\n","3828":"I will arrange this for you today and I will confirm in an email once done - It will go

then pulled over is that the right way?\nOr you need to add something like this\n","5805":"Oh, I'm afraid it is usually a different process, due to the eBooks are protected by a DRM license, it is

you are using was being used by some one else before?\n","5816":"Was just the login\n","5817":"Or do you know if those eBooks were transferred to the #PRS_ORG# from a third-party source?\nI was able

much.\nIf that is the case, I'm afraid you would need to sign into the same account you used to make the purchase so it can download into the #PRS_ORG#.\nIt wouldn't be possible to use the eBook while you are using a different #PRS_ORG# account on the #PRS_ORG#, I'm afraid.\nSomething I could suggest is that you try to download our #PRS_ORG# App in the computer and then sign into the #PRS_ORG# account you used for the purchase to download your eBooks there.\nYou can download the Desktop App from here:\nOnce you have the Desktop App installed on your computer, we could verify if the

#NUMBER# a month, can I only go to the gym 5 times a month for having only 5 credits?\n","6725":"With our credits system you\u2019ll get a certain amount of credits each month.\nClasses are worth different credit amounts based on a few factors.\nSo the number of classes that you can attend would depend on the credit value of the classes that you are booking.\nYou would not be limited to 5 visits.\n","6726":"I in case I just want to go to gym to work out in person\nI don't make much question of online class\n","6727":"Yes, you're welcome to only attend in-person classes.\n","6728":"Dx I

the credit value of the classes that you book.\nThe number of credits needed to book a class may change based on the time you\u2019re booking, what studio you\u2019re visiting, and what time your class is.\nIf you exceed #NUMBER# credits during your cycle you will need to purchase more if you wish to attend more classes.\n","6734":"I understood more or less\nOnly one more thing\nFor example\nThe plan of #NUMBER# only measures 5 credit, if the normal class in the academy is 1 credit can only go 5 times in the month\n","6735":"Yes, that is correct you would only be able to go 5 times in a month.\nApologies for the confusion.\nI thought you were talking about a #NUMBER# credit plan previously not a 5 credit plan.\n","6736":"All right.\nKkkkk\n","6737":"Any other

more about how #PRS_ORG# works.\n#PRS_ORG# is a monthly subscription service which provides access to the world\u2019s largest fitness network.\nWe partner with over 20,000 studios in cities all over the world to offer both in-person classes as well as livestream options.\nEach month you get a certain number of credits to use: the number of classes you can take each cycle depends on your membership plan, and you choose how to use your credits.\nYou can book classes ranging from yoga to barre to cycling to martial arts.\nIn many cities, there are also wellness options like massages or haircuts!\nWhen you sign up, you'll also have access to our video on-demand library.\nThis is included in your membership, and there are tons of videos available.\nSo if you are wanting to try out a new type of workout or just want to get in a workout at home, I encourage you to check those out.\nA few tips to get you up and running #PRS_ORG#:\nWhen you sign up, your membership starts that day.\nYour membership will auto-renew every month on that date.\nTo see the studios near you, check out the search page.\nJust click through the individual studio links to access their schedules!\nOn our website, you'll also be able to see the livestream classes many studios offer.\nYou'll be able to book classes through our website or app.\nThe studio will automatically receive your request and save you a spot.\nIf you can't make it, just be sure to cancel at least 12 hours in advance to avoid fees.\nBe sure to check out our Help Center for more information about how #PRS_ORG# works.\nIf you have any questions, let me know.\nHappy to clarify here!\nYou won't have access to class credit pricing without an active membership, but to give you an idea of how our system works, the number of credits needed to book a class is adjusted based on the time you\u2019re booking, what studio you\u2019re visiting, and what time your class is.\nWhile we\u2019re not able to provide a definitive number right now, if there\u2019s a particular studio you\u2019re interested in visiting, we can give you a range of how many credits each class could be.\nJust keep in mind that classes do change dynamically and in real time!\n","6783":"Hello,\nI would like to know more\n","6784":"Hello there!\nMy name is #NAME# and I'll be happy to help you!\nThank you for reaching us here on

which is why your payment method on file was charged.\nWhile I\u2019m unable to retroactively cancel your account, what I can do is apply a monetary credit to your membership in the amount of R$567
