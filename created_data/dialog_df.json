#ADDRESS# #EMAIL#\n---\nagent: Thank you, please bear with me a moment\nI can see your #PRS_ORG#, Schwarzgrau is still being shipped to us from our manufacturer overseas and due to be dispatched from us 12.01.21.\nI have looked into this for you and can see there has been a slight shipping delay with the item causing the dispatch date to be pushed back.\nThis is currently delayed 29 days.\nWe get shipping updates every day and it is possible that this date will change and hopefully for the better.\nWe have had a few deliveries that have arrived quicker than expected but we are unable to say for sure.\nThere\u2019s currently a lot of pressure on global shipping around the world.\nAs a result, our products are taking longer to arrive into ports.\nThis does unfortunately mean that your dispatch date may change, or your order could be delayed.\nAs soon as it reaches our distribution centre we'll send it right over to our delivery partners.\nYou'll get another email to let you know it's been sent and give you a tracking number.\nOur delivery partners will then be in touch to arrange an exact delivery date.\nDelivery usually takes place within 1-7 working days after dispatch but this can vary depending on the couriers availability in your area.\n---\nclient: Sorry, that doesn't satisfy me.\nI'm already waiting for my sofa for almost 8 weeks!\nI ask them to speed up the whole process.\nSo I am absolutely not satisfied!\n---\nagent: Regrettably as we do not have control over the speeds of the shipping processes we are unable to expedite orders, the item is still on a boat but we are doing our best to get it to you as soon as possible.\nAny delays the item may encounter on its way to our distribution center are out of our hands and cannot be predicted.\n---\nclient: And now?\nShould I sit or lie on the floor?\nThis is not okay\n---\nagent: I understand this is frustrating and disappointing.\nIf you would like to continue with the order we can of course look into compensating you for the delay in receiving the item.\nWe would ask you to contact us once you have received the item so we can take into account the length of the delay and your full customer journey.\nPlease advise if the item does arrive sooner than currently stated we may not be able to offer compensation.\nHowever we do completely understand if you do not want to wait anymore and the option to cancel the item is there if needed.\n---\nclient: No I want the article, I have already paid it!\nI am just not satisfied and can't understand if you advertise initially with a 4-6 weeks delivery time.\nNow I have to sit on the floor and lie that's not okay!\n---\nagent: I understand it is frustrating and disappointing and we are doing all we can to get the item to you as soon as possible.\nRegrettably the delays cannot be avoided.\nIs there anything else I can help with today please?\nThank you for chatting today.\nI'm going to end the chat now but just click the button if you have any other queries.\nYou will shortly be receiving an email to rate our chat today.\nIf you have a moment may I ask that you do fill this in please or alternatively thank you again and have a

understand this - but this is torn\/worn, this is not to do with the quality of the item.\nwas this here when you first received the chair?\n---\nclient: You can align your manager with the fact that they have lost two regular customers.\nMy friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.\nWe will no longer do that.\nNo, the defect occurred only after a few months.\nAn office chair must withstand normal use.\nOtherwise they may not sell him as an office chair.\nRegardless of this, the warranty is valid for Von 24 months.\n---\nagent: Okay, did you let us know about this after the few months that this happened?\n---\nclient: Obviously, the chair had an invisible lack of sale.\nHow else can such a padding damage occur after 9 months?\n---\nagent: Okay, did you let us know about this after the few months that this happened?\n---\nclient: Yes, I already reported a few months ago.\nUnfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.\nWe informed ourselves legally again and therefore wrote them again.\nWe originally reported half a year ago.\n---\nagent: Okay, bear with me whilst I look at this information\n---\nclient: Ok, thank you\n---\nagent: Okay, I can see the previous correspondence - regrettably, we are unable to move forward with this - I am very sorry for the disappointment\n---\nclient: All right.\nWe will no longer

the \u20ac15 voucher as a good will gesture\n---\nclient: What is the reason for this?\nIf you do not meet your own appointment.\nOr have written on 3 November that my goods were shipped\n---\nagent: We can only apologise for the delay you have experienced with the shipping and customs but as the item was only delayed 11 days past our original promise date I am unable to refund the shipping charges\nIs there anything else I can help with today?\n---\nclient: I must honestly admit that I am very disappointed about the #PRS_ORG# behavior and cannot understand the decision of your manager\nFrom 11 December to 8 January are again 1 month\nI don't know who is to blame\nAt the end of the day, you are responsible for your logistics partners and require impudent sums for a delivery that obviously didn't run smoothly\n---\nagent: I understand your points but I am unable to move on this, I will arrange the voucher for you and have this emailed to you\n---\nclient: I believe you have done everything in your power but I would like to redeem instead of a credit\nI don't have to order again from you as a customer\nI'm more than angry\nPlease pay it back to the original means of

scarcely 400euro\n---\nagent: I am checking for you now.\nThe last maximum amount we can offer you is 25 \u20ac.\nWe would not normally refund this amount for a 5 day dispatch delay.\nThe reason for the delay in delivering your item is caused by the carrier's availability.\nWe dispatched our end 5 days late.\n---\nclient: Well, I see them stubbornly and the delivery delay is ultimately also to be

you directly\nCan I help with anything else today?\n---\nclient: So that means, it doesn't have to be in the original carton and I can also glue the carton together somehow?\n---\nagent: As long as it is packaged for the collection then that is fine\n---\nclient: Is this communication stored and can another employee read the communication?\nIf I want to cancel the other dresser

information which shows on your order confirmation, then this will be the most accurate information we can provide\nThe dispatch times provided for each item on the website indicate how far through the manufacturing and shipping process the item is.\nThe longer dispatch times mean the item is likely still in the manufacturing phase, whereas shorter dispatch times mean the item is almost with us; this is why they will be ready to dispatch sooner.\nI regret this means we are not able to expedite orders.\n---\nclient: This is no problem for me as long as the shipping times are adhered to.\nCan one assume that these 3-4 months are realistic, or is there a great probability that it will be later?\n---\nagent: It can fluctuate either way.\nAny updates we receive which apply to the supply chain of your item, will show in an updated dispatch estimate.\nIt is not unusual for these to fluctuate throughout the process.\nDue to the unpredictability of the port congestion globally, some items have been delayed, but some are also being dispatched to customers sooner\nIf we can get your order into our warehouse sooner, it will begin preparing for dispatch immediately and you will be notified by email\nYou can check the progress of your order (the date of dispatch from our warehouse to the courier) through your 'my account' and 'my orders'.\nIf you have not set up an account and a pass word then please enter the email address used to place the order and use the 'forgotten password?'\noption to gain access to this information.\n---\nclient: Perfect\n---\nagent: Is there anything else I can help with?\n---\nclient: That's all.\nI'm lucky with the information\n---\nagent: If there are any delays, or you change your mind then cancellation is free of charge until the item is preparing to dispatch\nSo in this case, just let us know if you wish to cancel\nIf there is nothing else I can help with, then thank you for taking the time to talk with me today and I hope I have managed to

if you would prefer\n---\nclient: No thanks.\nThen I accept the 100\u20ac refund\nDo they have my bank details?\n---\nagent: I will arrange this for you today and I will confirm in an email once done

this\n---\nagent: Oh, I'm afraid it is usually a different process, due to the eBooks are protected by a DRM license, it is possible you cannot open it if you drag the file to the #PRS_ORG#.\nAre you using an #PRS_ORG# that is not related to us?\n---\nclient: But the #PRS_ORG#\n---\nagent: It is a #PRS_ORG#?\n---\nclient: Yes.\n---\nagent: Thank you so much!\nIf that is the case, you would need be

another person with whom there is no contact\n#EMAIL#\n---\nagent: That seems to be the source of the problem, if the #PRS_ORG# has a different account instead of yours, you will only be able to see the eBooks that are available on that account.\nPlease, allow me a moment to find this account.\nThe #PRS_ORG# Touch you are using was being used by some one else before?\n---\nclient: Was just the

information is not matching.\n---\nclient: But they fit\nBut they were probably third-party providers\n---\nagent: Thank you very much.\nIf that is the case, I'm afraid you would need to sign into the same account you used to make the purchase so it can download into the #PRS_ORG#.\nIt wouldn't be possible to use the eBook while you are using a different #PRS_ORG# account on the #PRS_ORG#, I'm afraid.\nSomething I could suggest is that you try to download our #PRS_ORG# App in the computer and then sign into the #PRS_ORG# account you used for the purchase to download your eBooks there.\nYou can download the Desktop App from here:\nOnce you have the Desktop App installed on your computer, we could verify if the #PRS_ORG# can be synced using the computer and the Desktop App.\nIf it works, maybe we could try to sign out of the account you have on the #PRS_ORG# and sign into the account you used to purchase the eBook.\n---\nclient: That sounds great:) a question of the herr, then the books are gesicvhert\n---\nagent: Yes, that is correct!\nAll the eBooks purchased in #PRS_ORG# are protected by a DRM license that only gives you exclusive access when you are using the account you used to purchase them.\nAs well, due to this license, it is just possible to open the eBooks in our #PRS_ORG# devices and in #PRS_ORG# , as an exception.\n---\nclient: Ok #NAME# we will think about it\nPardon\nThe last book appears in the download as acsm file\nIs this normal\n---\nagent: No problem, it is a pleasure to help you!\nAnd yes, that is normal, that is the .acsm file that you can open in #PRS_ORG#.\nDue to the same DRM license, the eBook can only be opened using this file in #PRS_ORG# or in our #PRS_ORG#  Apps or #PRS_ORG#.\n---\nclient: We also download it down the #PRS_ORG# edition\nI thank them for today\n---\nagent: Perfect!\nIf you open the eBook in #PRS_ORG#, you can read it there with no problems!\nAnd thank you so much, it is a pleasure for me to help you!\nIs
